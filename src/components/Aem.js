                <p>Self-Hosted — This typically means that the organization is completely responsible for the entire server setup, or more accurately that Adobe is NOT responsible. This requires that a company have an actual license key from Adobe. Within this option are actually a few choices: physical on-premise server, private/public cloud, or a managed service provider. Whatever the option chosen, the company will be responsible for handling all code deployments, including software patches and upgrades. A CDN could be used, but the organization will need to set it up and manage it on their own.</p>
